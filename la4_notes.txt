$4 is the remaining binary string/value from the input that has yet to be converted to a decimal, it decreases when a digit is added to the output

$5 holds the most recent single digit that has been taken from the input
$6 ends up being the full final output read as signle digits using hexadecimal

General Purpose Input and Output
- Does that mean SW is gpio_in and the hesdisplays are gpio_out
GPIO_in
GPIO_out
The value read from GPIO (in `sra`) will be stored in the destination (i think sra should be srl)
	  register (rd).
The value written to GPIO (in `srl`) will be sourced from the source
	  register (rs).
	  
	  
Counter.dat = instemem.dat


Pipelining:
FEW, each can work on a different instruction
each instruction must have it's F,E,and W done in different cycles starting with F->E->W
